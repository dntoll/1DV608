After completing the assignment the student should have...

 * know how PHP classes are constructed, objects are created.
 * used exceptions, error handling.
 * enquired some strategies for problem solving and debugging without a debugger.

##Rules
Assignment three is an individual assignment, you are not allowed to copy or share solutions from or with other students.
 
##CSQUIZ
Assignment 3 is done in the online editor CSQUIZ.

Assignment 3 consists of a number of different tasks. Each task has an instruction, an multifile editor area and a number of automated unit tests that needs to be fulfilled before going to the next assignment. There are a couple of task variations and different students may get different tasks or order of tasks.

CSQUIZ allows us to record and replay how the programming tasks were solved. CSQUIZ only records activities in the active browser window. This allows us to improve the tool and tasks as well as learning on how students solve assignments. All recordings are done anonymously unless you add personal information into the coding area, so please do not do that.
