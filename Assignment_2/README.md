##Goals

Assignment 2 aims to let you work with real tools, requirements, tests and release a web application on a public server.

After completing the assignment the student should have...
 * ...worked with tools and servers
 * ...read and successfully implemented requirements with PHP
 * ...tested those requirements carefully.
 * ...created an application with functionality similar to the example application.
 
## Rules
The Assignment is done individually! You are not allowed to copy or take solutions from others.

All mandatory test-cases should be successful for the assignment to be approved (minimum for Grade E).
For higher grades some or all of the volontary test-cases should be fullfilled.
 
## Task 1. Explore requirements and test-cases.

The requirements of the application is written below and consists of three use-cases.

[Use Cases](Assignment2_Use_Cases.md)

For each of the use-cases there are a number of test-cases. The test cases are given in the following format. 
 * Input, steps to do. In some cases another test-case, if so do the input steps of that test-case.
 * Output, things you should observe or not observe if the test-case is successful.
 * Image, an image of the result after Input steps are done.
 
Testing of the application requires two different browsers, and a tool to manipulate cookies, like "firebug".
