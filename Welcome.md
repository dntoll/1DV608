Here is some quick information about the course.

 * The course-language is going to be English. Lectures and course material is going to be in English. Questions may be asked in Swedish or English.
 * Make sure you fulfill the prerequisites for the course, if you do not you will get unregistered.
 * There are going to be a LOT of tight deadlines, make sure you plan for a lot of programming during the course. Start early and try to submit before deadline. The deadlines are specified here: https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/webbutveckling-med-php/laborationsmiljo/deadlines/
 * Missing a deadline or not completing an assignment within the deadline, will result in a new examination task.
 * There will be a lot of students on the course, campus Kalmar, campus Växjö, and online. Each group will have its own schedule with common lectures.

Lectures and labs will be added as they are completed.

The following communication strategy is going to be used in the course.
