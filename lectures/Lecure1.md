### PHP as a language

PHP is an interpreted script language.

It is hated and loved (and so by me)


Some of PHP features:
 * It is huge on the server side... http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all
 * Easy to deploy
 * Fast development time (hacks)
 * Lots of great communities, lots of examples, lots of developers.

Some of the downsides:
 * It is weakly typed (with type hinting). (PHP7)
 * It is slow for number crunching
 * It hard to manage larger applications.

### Model, View, Controller A quick intro

Why do we need an architecture?
 * map
 * design guide
 * reusable design
 * constraints that help us define solution space


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller

 * Model Business rules (what would be the same for all use-cases)
 * Controller (Use cases, makes changes to the model depending on user input)
 * View (interface, generates what user sees)

Please note that MVC has many different interpretations and versions.
(check an image search on google)

### Input validation and filtration
View as a layer against the user.

Should every input be considered harmful?
What about cookies? Encrypted connections?


### View 
The views responsibilities are to translate input to higher level input and generate output.

####Server(PHP) to browser
HTML, Javascript, Images, CSS, URL, setcookie-headers, status code(200 OK)

All this can be generated by PHP.

#### Example HTMLView

namespaces, class, private, public, constructor, member variable, parameters

####Browser to server(PHP)
url, post, cookies, file-upload

Syncronous
(ajax)

#### Example UserPicker
